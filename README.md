# Personal Finance Tracker

A simple Python-based personal finance tracker that stores transactions in CSV format
and predicts next month's expenses using recent trends.

## Features
- Add income and expense transactions
- Monthly summaries
- Category breakdown
- Expense trend calculation
- Simple next-month expense prediction

## Prediction Logic
The prediction is based on:
- The average expenses of the last months
- The recent change (trend) in expenses

This approach is chosen to remain explainable and suitable for small datasets.

## Technologies
- Python
- CSV file handling
- Basic statistics

## Notes
This project focuses on applied logic rather than complex machine learning models,
making it suitable for small personal datasets.
